# Hand Gesture for Cursor control

## Summary
An open-source project to control your cursor using right hand index finger movement.  

## Motivation
Last year I was awestruck and quite amused by the some Arduino projects my friends from Electric Engineering department created.  
One of most interest to me was the gesture control project that allowed you to switch slides or TV channels just with the wave of your hand. Cool isn't it!!  
That got me thinking on how I can use some software to detect gestures and build something cool out of it.  
My curiosity led me down to discovery the awesome MediaPipe library and rest is history!  

I ended up creating this project which I named as **HandGestureControl** due to lack of any better names I could come up with.  

The project is aimed to let you control your cursor with the right hand index finger, so no need to buy an expensive touch screen laptop for now when I can do some cool stuff with software, atleast that's how I can control my craving for one!  

**Tech Stack:** Python  

**Libraries Used:** MediaPipe, AutoPy, OpenCV & NumPy
